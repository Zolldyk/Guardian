# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Strong input validation via Pydantic regex patterns. No hardcoded secrets. Error messages don't leak sensitive information. Path objects prevent directory traversal."

    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient JSON parsing with native libraries. Minimal I/O operations. No unnecessary loops. Historical price data loaded on-demand."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with try/except blocks. Custom exception classes. Proper logging at INFO level. Edge cases well-covered."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Self-documenting code with comprehensive docstrings. Clear function responsibilities. Modern Pydantic v2 patterns. Minimal technical debt."

# Detailed assessment summary
assessment:
  requirements_traceability:
    status: complete
    coverage: "9/9 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated"
    highlights:
      - "Portfolio Pydantic models use modern v2 syntax (ConfigDict, model_validator)"
      - "29/30 historical price tokens downloaded with 90-day coverage"
      - "3 realistic demo portfolios with varying risk profiles ($135K/$89K/$149K)"
      - "13 comprehensive unit tests plus integration tests"
      - "Excellent documentation (DEMO_WALLETS.md exceeds expectations)"

  code_quality:
    status: excellent
    highlights:
      - "Clean separation of concerns (models.py schemas + portfolio_utils.py logic)"
      - "Full compliance with coding standards (naming, error handling, logging)"
      - "Comprehensive docstrings with Args/Returns/Raises/Examples"
      - "Type hints on all function signatures"
      - "Custom InvalidPortfolioError provides clear error semantics"

  test_coverage:
    status: comprehensive
    highlights:
      - "13 unit tests covering valid/invalid scenarios"
      - "Proper use of pytest fixtures and unittest.mock"
      - "Integration test validates all 3 real demo wallets"
      - "Edge cases well-covered (zero values, empty lists, missing fields)"

  enhancements_performed:
    - file: "agents/shared/models.py"
      change: "Added @model_validator to Portfolio class (lines 78-87)"
      reason: "Ensures total_value_usd matches sum of token values, preventing data inconsistencies"
      impact: "Catches calculation errors at parse time instead of downstream analysis"
