# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Win ASI Alliance Hackathon top prize by demonstrating best-in-class multi-agent collaboration
- Reveal hidden portfolio risks (correlation blindness and sector concentration) that standard trackers miss
- Transform abstract risk metrics into visceral understanding through historical crash simulations
- Validate product-market fit for DeFi portfolio intelligence through demo feedback
- Build extensible foundation for post-hackathon product evolution

## Background Context

DeFi investors face a dangerous illusion: they believe holding 10-15 different tokens means they're diversified, but during market crashes discover everything drops together. A typical scenario: "I thought I was diversified but everything crashed 70% overnight." This risk blindness stems from two hidden structural problems—portfolios that are 95% correlated to ETH (creating 3x leveraged exposure) and dangerous sector concentration (68% in governance tokens that collapse together).

Guardian solves this through multi-agent intelligence: specialized agents analyze correlation structure and sector concentration independently, then an orchestrator synthesizes findings to reveal compounding risks that neither dimension shows alone. Using the "time machine" approach, Guardian transforms abstract statistics into concrete insights: "Your portfolio is 95% correlated to ETH—portfolios with this structure lost 73% in the 2022 crash versus 55% market average." Built for the ASI Alliance Hackathon, Guardian demonstrates how specialized agents collaborating through the Fetch.ai/SingularityNET ecosystem can provide judgment and interpretation, not just data dashboards.
