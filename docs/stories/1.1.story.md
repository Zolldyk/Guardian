**Important Note:** For this story, create the complete directory structure but only populate the files required by the acceptance criteria. Empty placeholder directories are acceptable for future stories.

### Environment Configuration
Environment variables are managed using python-dotenv package. All configuration is loaded from a `.env` file (not committed to git).

**Required Environment Variables (for .env.example):**
```bash
# Agent Addresses (assigned by Agentverse on deployment)
GUARDIAN_ADDRESS=agent1qy4mj8k2nqz...
CORRELATION_AGENT_ADDRESS=agent1qw9xth4kl2p...
SECTOR_AGENT_ADDRESS=agent1qx7bvc3mn8s...

# Agent Seeds (for deterministic address generation)
GUARDIAN_SEED=<secret_seed_guardian>
CORRELATION_AGENT_SEED=<secret_seed_correlation>
SECTOR_AGENT_SEED=<secret_seed_sector>

# MeTTa Configuration
METTA_ENABLED=true
METTA_KNOWLEDGE_PATH=./data/metta_knowledge/

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Environment Configuration]

**Security Note:** The .env file must be added to .gitignore to prevent committing secrets. Only .env.example should be committed with placeholder values.

### Development Workflow Commands
These are the standard commands developers will use throughout the project:

**Initial Setup:**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
```
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Local Development Setup]

**Development Commands:**
```bash
# Run unit tests
pytest tests/test_agents.py -v

# Run integration tests (requires deployed agents)
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v

# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=agents --cov-report=html

# Lint code
ruff check agents/

# Type check
mypy agents/

# Run local agent for development (Guardian example)
python agents/guardian.py
```
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#Local Development Setup]

### Coding Standards
All code must follow these project-specific rules:

**Naming Conventions:**
- Agent Files: snake_case (e.g., `correlation_agent.py`)
- Agent Names: snake_case (e.g., `correlation_agent`)
- Message Models: PascalCase (e.g., `AnalysisRequest`)
- Message Handlers: snake_case with `handle_` prefix (e.g., `handle_analysis_request`)
- Data Files: kebab-case (e.g., `demo-wallets.json`)
- Environment Variables: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `CORRELATION_AGENT_ADDRESS`)

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming Conventions]

**Critical Rules (for future stories, but good to understand now):**
- Never hardcode agent addresses - always load from environment variables
- All message handlers must wrap logic in try/except blocks
- All inter-agent messages must be logged at INFO level
- All `ctx.wait_for_message()` calls must specify timeout parameter (default: 10 seconds)

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Critical Fullstack Rules]

### Testing

**Testing Framework:** pytest 8.4.2 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

**Test File Locations:**
- Unit tests: `tests/test_agents.py` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]
- Integration tests: `tests/test_integration.py` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Integration Tests]

**Testing Standards for this Story:**
- Create basic unit tests for hello world agent in `tests/test_hello_world.py`
- Use `unittest.mock` (Python stdlib) for mocking uAgents messages and agent context [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
- Coverage target: 70% code coverage on critical business logic [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]
- All tests must pass in CI/CD pipeline before merging

**Example Test Pattern:**
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock

def test_hello_world_agent_initialization():
    """Test agent initializes without errors."""
    # Test implementation here
    pass
```
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]

**CI/CD Integration:**
GitHub Actions workflow must include:
- Linting with ruff: `ruff check agents/`
- Type checking with mypy: `mypy agents/`
- Pytest execution with coverage: `pytest --cov=agents --cov-report=xml`
- Workflow triggers on push/PR to main/develop branches

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]

### Project Structure Notes
No conflicts identified between epic requirements and architecture. The repository structure defined in the architecture aligns perfectly with AC #2 (monorepo structure with agents/, data/, tests/, docs/ folders).

### Additional Context
**Agentverse Platform:** This is the deployment platform for all agents. For this story, you'll deploy a "hello world" agent to Agentverse testnet to verify the deployment process works. Future stories will deploy production agents (Guardian, CorrelationAgent, SectorAgent). [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

**uAgents Framework Learning:** AC #11 requires understanding the message-passing pattern and agent registration process. Key concepts to document:
- Agents are autonomous entities that communicate via asynchronous message-passing
- Agent registration with Agentverse provides unique addresses (agent1qw...)
- Message handlers are defined using decorators in uAgents framework
- Communication is asynchronous (agents don't block waiting for responses)

[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#Technical Summary]

**Innovation Lab Resources:** Reference Fetch.ai Innovation Lab documentation for:
- uAgents framework tutorials
- Hello world agent examples
- Inter-agent communication patterns
- Agentverse deployment guides

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Strong foundation with excellent test coverage (14 tests, 80% coverage) and comprehensive documentation. The implementation demonstrates solid understanding of uAgents framework concepts and follows modern Python practices.

**Strengths**:
- Well-structured codebase following monorepo pattern
- Comprehensive README.md with clear setup instructions and framework concepts
- Robust test suite with proper use of mocking for async handlers
- Clean separation of concerns (agents, shared utilities, tests)
- Proper error handling in message handlers
- Good logging practices throughout

**Issues Identified and Resolved**:
- Hardcoded agent addresses and seeds violated project coding standards
- Missing integration test file caused CI warnings
- .gitignore incorrectly excluded docs/ directory
- Incomplete environment variable documentation

All issues have been addressed through refactoring (see below).

### Refactoring Performed

All refactoring completed successfully with 100% test pass rate maintained.

- **File**: agents/shared/config.py
  - **Change**: Created centralized configuration module for environment variable loading
  - **Why**: Project coding standards require "Never hardcode agent addresses - always load from environment variables"
  - **How**: Implements get_env_var() helper with defaults, loads all agent seeds and addresses from environment

- **File**: agents/hello_world_agent.py
  - **Change**: Replaced hardcoded seed with environment variable via config.py
  - **Why**: Violated coding standard: "Never hardcode agent addresses"
  - **How**: Imported HELLO_WORLD_AGENT_SEED from shared.config, maintains deterministic address generation

- **File**: agents/test_client_agent.py
  - **Change**: Replaced hardcoded seed and address with environment variables via config.py
  - **Why**: Violated coding standard for hardcoded values
  - **How**: Imported TEST_CLIENT_AGENT_SEED and HELLO_WORLD_AGENT_ADDRESS from shared.config, updated startup logging to display loaded address

- **File**: .env.example
  - **Change**: Added AGENT SEEDS section with HELLO_WORLD_AGENT_SEED and TEST_CLIENT_AGENT_SEED
  - **Why**: AC #4 requires "all required environment variables documented" - seeds were missing
  - **How**: Added new section with security warnings and default values for learning agents

- **File**: tests/test_integration.py
  - **Change**: Created integration test stub with placeholder tests
  - **Why**: CI workflow (ci.yml:79) references test_integration.py but file didn't exist, causing warnings
  - **How**: Created file with TestAgentCommunication class containing skipped tests for future stories, plus passing placeholder test

- **File**: .gitignore
  - **Change**: Removed docs/ exclusion, added .ai/ exclusion
  - **Why**: docs/ contains committed architecture/PRD files but was marked as ignored (inconsistency)
  - **How**: Replaced "docs/" with ".ai/" to properly exclude AI debug logs while allowing documentation

**Verification**: All tests pass (14/14), linting clean (ruff), type checking clean (mypy), 80% coverage maintained.
