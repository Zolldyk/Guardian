## Dev Notes

### Story Context

**Purpose:** Story 3.4 creates comprehensive documentation that enables hackathon judges to independently evaluate Guardian without creator assistance. This documentation is critical for hackathon submission success, as judges must be able to test the system, understand the architecture, and appreciate the multi-agent innovation.

**Key Objectives:**
- Create judge-friendly documentation covering all testing scenarios
- Explain multi-agent architecture and design rationale
- Provide clear step-by-step testing instructions
- Demonstrate system transparency with sample responses
- Follow Innovation Lab README best practices for agent discoverability

**Documentation Scope:**
- README.md (enhanced with judge-focused content)
- ARCHITECTURE.md (new file explaining design decisions)
- DEMO.md (new file with step-by-step testing guide)
- docs/sample-responses/ (complete set of expected responses)

---

### Current State Analysis

**Existing Documentation:**
- README.md exists with basic setup instructions [Source: /Users/pc/Guardian/README.md]
- docs/architecture/ contains detailed technical architecture (sharded) [Source: docs/architecture/index.md]
- docs/sample-responses/ has 2 files: multi-turn-conversation-example.md, wallet-1-high-risk-transparency.md
- No ARCHITECTURE.md at docs/ level (judge-friendly version)
- No DEMO.md exists yet

**Documentation Gaps (to be filled by this story):**
1. README.md lacks problem statement, value proposition, agent addresses, demo wallets, sample conversation
2. No consolidated ARCHITECTURE.md for judges (existing architecture docs are developer-focused and sharded)
3. No DEMO.md with step-by-step testing instructions
4. docs/sample-responses/ incomplete (missing Demo Wallet 2 and 3 responses)

---

### Multi-Agent Architecture (for Documentation)

**System Components:**
1. **Guardian Orchestrator Agent** - Central coordinator that receives user queries via ASI:One Chat Protocol, delegates analysis to specialized agents, synthesizes results to identify compounding risks, and generates actionable recommendations [Source: docs/architecture/components.md:6-24]

2. **CorrelationAgent** - Calculates portfolio correlation to ETH using historical price data, queries MeTTa for historical crash performance patterns [Source: docs/architecture/components.md:85-93]

3. **SectorAgent** - Maps portfolio tokens to sector classifications, calculates sector concentration percentages, identifies dangerous concentration (>60%) [Source: docs/architecture/components.md:165-173]

**Message Flow Pattern:**
```
User (ASI:One) → Guardian → [CorrelationAgent, SectorAgent] → MeTTa Knowledge Graph
                    ↓
              Synthesis Logic (detects compounding risks)
                    ↓
              Recommendations → User (ASI:One)
```

[Source: docs/architecture/agentverse-deployment-guide.md:411-444]

---

### Technology Stack (for Documentation)

**Core Technologies:**
- **uAgents 0.22.10** - Agent framework for multi-agent communication [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:10]
- **Agentverse Platform** - Agent hosting and runtime environment [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:11]
- **ASI:One Chat Protocol** - Conversational interface for natural language interaction [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:12]
- **MeTTa (Hyperon 0.2.6)** - Semantic knowledge graph for historical crash data [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:13]
- **Python 3.10+** - Backend implementation language [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:9]

**Dual-Deployment Strategy:**
- Local agents (*_local.py) - Full Python ecosystem with pandas/numpy for development
- Hosted agents (*_hosted.py) - Agentverse-compatible libraries only for production
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md:48-77]

---

### Agent Addresses (to be documented)

**IMPORTANT:** Agent addresses must be retrieved from deployed Agentverse agents and documented in README.md. This story assumes stories 3.2 and 3.3 have been completed manually, meaning all agents are deployed.

**Expected Addresses Format:**
- Guardian Agent: `agent1q...` (retrieve from Agentverse deployment)
- CorrelationAgent: `agent1q...` (retrieve from Agentverse deployment)
- SectorAgent: `agent1q...` (retrieve from Agentverse deployment)

**Action Required:** Developer must retrieve actual agent addresses from Agentverse dashboard and populate README.md.

---

### Demo Wallets (to be documented)

**Demo Wallet Configuration:**
According to Story 1.2 and 3.3 requirements, the project should have 3 demo wallets with different risk profiles:

1. **Demo Wallet 1 (High Risk):** Portfolio with >90% ETH correlation + >65% DeFi governance concentration
2. **Demo Wallet 2 (Moderate Risk):** Portfolio with 80-85% correlation + moderate sector concentration (40-50%)
3. **Demo Wallet 3 (Well-Diversified):** Portfolio with <70% correlation + no sector >30%

**Action Required:** Developer must retrieve actual demo wallet addresses from data/demo-wallets.json and document them in README.md with expected risk profiles.

[Source: docs/prd/epic-details.md:611-622]

---

### Innovation Lab README Best Practices

**Required Sections for Agent Discoverability:**
1. **Clear Description** - 2-3 sentence explanation of what agent does
2. **Example Queries** - 5+ natural language queries users can try
3. **How it Works** - Brief explanation of approach
4. **Technical Details** - Agent type, response time, data sources, dependencies
5. **Limitations** - Clear statement of what agent cannot do
6. **Example Output** - Sample response showing agent capabilities

[Source: docs/architecture/agentverse-deployment-guide.md:320-350]

**Documentation should enable:**
- Judges to discover Guardian via ASI:One natural language search
- Judges to test Guardian independently without creator assistance
- Judges to understand multi-agent collaboration and synthesis logic
- Judges to verify expected responses using sample-responses/ directory

---

### ASI:One Testing Instructions (for DEMO.md)

**ASI:One Access Flow:**
1. Navigate to ASI:One chat interface (URL to be documented)
2. Search for "Guardian" or "portfolio risk analysis"
3. Select Guardian agent from search results
4. Send natural language query with demo wallet address
5. Wait for Guardian response (expected <60 seconds)
6. Verify response includes correlation analysis, sector analysis, and synthesis

**Sample Query Format:**
- "Analyze wallet [DEMO_WALLET_ADDRESS]"
- "What are the risks in portfolio [DEMO_WALLET_ADDRESS]?"
- "Give me a risk assessment for [DEMO_WALLET_ADDRESS]"

[Source: docs/architecture/agentverse-deployment-guide.md:413-423]

---

### Sample Responses Structure (for docs/sample-responses/)

**Expected Response Format:**
Each sample response file should include:

1. **Metadata Section:**
   - Wallet address
   - Analysis timestamp
   - Agent versions used
   - Total processing time

2. **CorrelationAgent Response:**
   - Correlation percentage
   - Interpretation (High/Moderate/Low)
   - Historical crash context
   - Narrative explanation

3. **SectorAgent Response:**
   - Sector breakdown percentages
   - Concentrated sectors identified
   - Sector-specific crash performance
   - Opportunity cost analysis

4. **Guardian Synthesis:**
   - Compounding risk detection
   - Risk multiplier narrative
   - Prioritized recommendations (2-3)
   - Final risk assessment

**Existing Files:**
- multi-turn-conversation-example.md - Shows conversational features from Story 3.1
- wallet-1-high-risk-transparency.md - High-risk portfolio analysis

**Files to Create:**
- wallet-2-moderate-risk.md - Moderate-risk portfolio analysis
