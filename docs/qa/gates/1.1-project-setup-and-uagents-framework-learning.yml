nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Agent seeds moved to environment variables (coding standard compliance). .env properly excluded from git. Example seeds acceptable for learning/demo code."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Simple hello world implementation, no performance concerns. Async handlers properly implemented. Test execution time acceptable (14 tests in 3.71s)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling present in all message handlers (try/except blocks). Logging configured appropriately at INFO level."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation in README.md. Clear code structure with proper separation of concerns. Coding standards fully met after refactoring."
